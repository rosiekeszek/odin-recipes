<p>This is my favorite fresh pasta sauce to make. The choice of pasta is up to you, I usually use ziti.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound of pasta, your choice</li>
    <li>one can of diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1/3 borwn onion</li>
    <li>dried chili pepper flakes</li>
    <li>5 or 6 mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 zucchini</li>
    <li>1 vegan sausage link</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add two tabelspoons of olive oil and half a teaspoon of chili flakes to a large cooking pot and warm over a medium flame</li>
        <li>Chop onion and garlic and add to pot</li>
        <li>When onion and garlic have become translucent add diced tomatoes (with juice)</li>
        <li>Slice mushrooms and add to pot</li>
        <li>Slice zucchini to preferred size and add to pot</li>
        <li>Slice sausage link to preferred size and add to pot</li>
        <li>Cover pot and simmer until zucchini is tender</li>
        <li>In a separate pot bring salted water to a boil, add pasta of choice, cook until done, drain</li>
        <li>If timed properly the past will be finished cooking about the same time as the sauce and can be added right into the pot, mixed, and served</li>
    </ul>
